I am a 1st year Biostatistics Masters student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, concentrating on Public Health Data Science. I graduated from UCLA in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Statistics and Data Science. 

I am excited to further my knowledge in the connection between public health and statistics/data science with my masters degree!
